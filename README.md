# Spam or Ham Email Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam).
The goal is to build an effective classifier that can help in filtering out unwanted spam emails and keeping the inbox clean. In this we used Logistic Regression algorithm to find the mail is spam or ham.


## Features

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare email data for analysis.

Feature Extraction: Convert email content into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF.

Model Training: Train various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction: Classify new emails as spam or ham.
